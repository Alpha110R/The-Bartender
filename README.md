# The-Bartender
The bartender is a project that i chose to do in my "Makerim" course, i had to choose by myself a project that will be fun, engaging and challenging.
I am new to the arduino world and C++ and i found that this world is very intresting and rewarding because you create somthing from scrach.
It nice to create phisical product that combain the software world. The software is the brain of the product that conducts all the different component in the project.
