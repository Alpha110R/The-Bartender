# The-Bartender
The bartender is a project that I chose to do in my "Makerim" course, I had to choose by myself a project that will be fun, engaging and challenging.
I am new to Arduino and I found it very interesting and rewarding. You create something new and design it how you want.
The bartender project is a challenging but at the same time a lot of fun. The main challenge I confront was learning all from scratch. I don't have any background in Arduino and its electricity needs. I learned how to study new subjects and technologies. Therefore I can take on a big project like this. It includes several sensors, water pumps, LCDs, and more components. All those components are connected to the Arduino.

The bartender can puor 2 or more drinks.
You can see the drink menu and the different amounts of liquid on the LCD. You can scroll and choose by the rotary button.
Moreover there are 2 buttons to change songs and music volume.
