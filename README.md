# The-Bartender
The bartender is a project that I chose to do in my "Makerim" course, I had to choose by myself a project that will be fun, engaging and challenging.
I am new to the Arduino world and C++ and I found that this world is very interesting and rewarding because you create something from scratch and I designed it how I want it to be.
The bartender is a challenging project but also a lot of fun. The main challenge I confront was learning all from scratch. I don't have any background in Arduino and its electricity needs, but I have a little bit of knowledge about C. I learned how to study new subjects and technologies. Therefore I can take on a big project like this. It includes several sensors, water pumps, LCDs, and more components. All those components are connected to the Arduino.

The bartender can puor 2 or more drinks.
You can see the drink menu and the different amounts of liquid on the LCD. You can scroll and choose by the rotary button.
Moreover there are 2 buttons to change songs and music volume.
